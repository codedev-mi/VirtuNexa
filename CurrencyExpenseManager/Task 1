Goal:
 Develop a Java application that allows users to convert between different currencies.

Structure:
     -User Interface: Design a console-based or GUI interface using Java frameworks.
     -Expense Management: Implement features for adding and categorizing them.
     -Reports: Generate expense reports, showing detailed breakdowns and summaries of expenses over time.

Technologies:
     -Java: For developing the applicationâ€™s core logic and features.
     -JDBC/SQLite: For database interaction (to store and retrieve expense data).
     -Swing: For building a GUI for better user interaction (if not a console application).

Checklist:
     -Design the system for expense tracking with relevant fields (amount, category, date, etc.).
     -Implement a report generation system that displays detailed reports of expenses.
     -Integrate database storage (e.g., SQLite) to persist the expense data.
