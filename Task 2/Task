Goal: Create a Java program to sort a list of numbers in ascending or descending order based on user input.

Structure:
-User Interface: Design a console-based or GUI interface using Java frameworks (e.g., Swing, JavaFX, or a simple CLI) tailored to the application's functionality and user experience.
-Core Logic Implementation: Implement the core logic and functionality of the application using clean, modular, and reusable Java code.
-Data Management: If applicable, design a system for storing and managing data (e.g., user inputs, application states, scores, or records). Use in-memory data structures or databases as per requirements.
-Error Handling and Validation: Include proper input validation, error handling, and exception management to ensure robust application behavior.
-Reports/Feedback (Optional): Add functionality to generate and display summaries, reports, or feedback based on user interaction or processed data.

Technologies:
-Java: Core language for application development.
-JDBC/SQLite: For database interaction (to store and retrieve application data).
-Swing/JavaFX (Optional): For building a GUI for enhanced user interaction.

Deliverables:
-Complete Java project files (including source code and necessary configuration files).
-Executable JAR file for running the application.
-Documentation of the application's functionality, usage, and setup.

Checklist:
-Design the user interface (console or GUI) to align with the application's goals.
-Implement core functionality using modular Java methods and classes.
-Integrate data storage mechanisms if specified (e.g., databases, JSON files).
-Ensure robust error handling and input validation.
-Test the application in different environments (e.g., various Java versions, operating systems).
-Package the project files, executable JAR, and documentation for submission.
