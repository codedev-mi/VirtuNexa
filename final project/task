Goal: Develop a personal diary application where users can store notes securely with encryption and password protection.

Structure:
    -User Interface: Design a console-based or GUI interface using Java frameworks (e.g., Swing, JavaFX, or a simple CLI) tailored to the application's functionality and user experience.
    -Core Logic Implementation: Implement the core logic and functionality of the application using clean, modular, and reusable Java code.
    -Data Management: If applicable, design a system for storing and managing data (e.g., user inputs, application states, scores, or records). Use in-memory data structures or databases as per requirements.
    -Error Handling and Validation: Include proper input validation, error handling, and exception management to ensure robust application behavior.
    -Reports/Feedback (Optional): Add functionality to generate and display summaries, reports, or feedback based on user interaction or processed data.

Technologies:
   -Java: Core language for application development.
   -JDBC/SQLite: For database interaction (to store and retrieve application data).
   -Swing/JavaFX (Optional): For building a GUI for enhanced user interaction.
